# Test file for power_grid_analysis.R  
# Tests will be implemented later when functions are complete

# TODO: Add tests for:
# - power_grid_analysis() function
# - Sample size and effect size grid analyses
# - Design prior parsing (brms syntax and R functions)
# - Integrated power computation
# - Model caching performance optimizations
# - Optimal combinations identification
# - Error handling for invalid inputs
