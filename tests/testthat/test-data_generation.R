# Test file for data generation functions
# Tests will be implemented later when functions are complete

# TODO: Add tests for:
# - Built-in data simulation functions for ANCOVA
# - Continuous outcome data generation
# - Binary outcome data generation
# - Count outcome data generation
# - Baseline covariate correlation
# - Effect size implementation accuracy
# - Data structure validation
