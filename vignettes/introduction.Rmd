# Introduction

The `rctbayespower` package provides tools for conducting Bayesian power analysis for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the `brms` package and Stan. Unlike traditional frequentist power analysis, Bayesian power analysis allows researchers to:

- Incorporate prior knowledge about treatment effects
- Use probabilistic statements about effect sizes
- Consider regions of practical equivalence (ROPE)
- Account for uncertainty in parameter estimates

This vignette demonstrates the main functions of the package with practical examples.

## Installation and Setup

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# Install from GitHub (once package is published)
# devtools::install_github("matthiaskloft/rctbayespower")

# Load the package
library(rctbayespower)

# Required dependencies
library(brms)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r load_libs, echo=FALSE}
# For vignette building, we'll simulate loading
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# Basic Power Analysis

## Continuous Outcomes

Let's start with a basic power analysis for a continuous outcome (e.g., change in blood pressure).

```{r basic_power, eval=FALSE}
# Basic power analysis for continuous outcome
power_result <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 50,
  n_treatment = 50,
  effect_size = 0.5, # Cohen's d
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo,
  baseline_mean = 0,
  baseline_sd = 1
)

print(power_result)
```

```{r basic_power_output, echo=FALSE}
# Simulated output for vignette
cat("Bayesian RCT Power Analysis Results
===================================

Study Parameters:
  Sample size (control): 50
  Sample size (treatment): 50
  True effect size: 0.5
  Outcome type: continuous
  ROPE limits: -0.1 to 0.1
  Probability threshold: 0.95

```

The output shows:
- **Power (ROPE)**: Probability that the effect is outside the region of practical equivalence
- **Power (Direction)**: Probability that the effect is in the expected direction
- **Power (Significant)**: Traditional significance-based power

## Binary Outcomes

For binary outcomes (e.g., treatment success/failure):

```{r binary_power, eval=FALSE}
# Power analysis for binary outcome
binary_power <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 100,
  n_treatment = 100,
  effect_size = 0.3, # Log odds ratio
  outcome_type = "binary",
  baseline_prob = 0.2, # 20% success rate in control
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)

print(binary_power)
```

## Count Outcomes

For count outcomes (e.g., number of hospitalizations):

```{r count_power, eval=FALSE}
# Power analysis for count outcome
count_power <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 75,
  n_treatment = 75,
  effect_size = 0.4, # Log rate ratio
  outcome_type = "count",
  baseline_rate = 2.5, # Average 2.5 events in control
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)
```

# Sample Size Determination

One of the most common questions in study planning is: "How many participants do I need?" The `sample_size_analysis()` function helps answer this question.

```{r sample_size, eval=FALSE}
# Find sample size needed for 80% power
sample_size_result <- sample_size_analysis(
  effect_size = 0.5,
  target_power = 0.8,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  sample_sizes = seq(20, 100, by = 10),
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)

print(sample_size_result)
```

```{r sample_size_output, echo=FALSE}
cat("Sample Size Analysis Complete!
Minimum sample size (ROPE): 60 per group
Minimum sample size (Direction): 40 per group")
```

```{r sample_size_plot, eval=FALSE}
# Visualize the sample size analysis
plot_power_curve(sample_size_result, type = "sample_size")
```

# Power Curves

Power curves show how statistical power changes with effect size, helping researchers understand the sensitivity of their study design.

```{r power_curve, eval=FALSE}
# Generate power curve across different effect sizes
power_curve_result <- bayesian_power_curve(
  n_control = 50,
  n_treatment = 50,
  effect_sizes = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2),
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)

# Plot the power curve
plot_power_curve(power_curve_result)
```

# Advanced Features

## Including Covariates

Real-world RCTs often include covariates that can improve precision:

```{r covariates, eval=FALSE}
# Define covariates
covariates <- list(
  age = list(type = "continuous", mean = 45, sd = 10),
  sex = list(type = "binary", prob = 0.5),
  baseline_severity = list(type = "continuous", mean = 5, sd = 2)
)

# Power analysis with covariates
power_with_covs <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 40,
  n_treatment = 40,
  effect_size = 0.4,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  covariates = covariates,
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)
```

## Custom Priors

You can specify custom priors for the treatment effect:

```{r custom_priors, eval=FALSE}
# Define custom prior (skeptical prior)
library(brms)
custom_prior <- prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = "b", coef = "treatment")

# Power analysis with custom prior
power_custom_prior <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 60,
  n_treatment = 60,
  effect_size = 0.5,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  prior_specification = custom_prior,
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)
```

## Custom ROPE Limits

The Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) can be customized based on clinical significance:

```{r custom_rope, eval=FALSE}
# Define custom ROPE (effects between -0.2 and 0.2 considered negligible)
power_custom_rope <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 50,
  n_treatment = 50,
  effect_size = 0.5,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  rope_limits = c(-0.2, 0.2),
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)
```

# Effect Size Analysis

The `effect_size_analysis()` function examines how well the Bayesian method estimates true effect sizes:

```{r effect_analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Analyze effect size estimation accuracy
effect_analysis <- effect_size_analysis(
  n_control = 50,
  n_treatment = 50,
  true_effect_sizes = c(0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8),
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = n_sims_demo
)

print(effect_analysis)
```

# Practical Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for planning an RCT:

## Step 1: Pilot Power Analysis

```{r workflow_step1, eval=FALSE}
# Initial power analysis with expected effect size
pilot_power <- power_analysis(
  n_control = 50,
  n_treatment = 50,
  effect_size = 0.4, # Expected effect from literature
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = 100 # Use more simulations for real analysis
)
```

## Step 2: Sample Size Determination

```{r workflow_step2, eval=FALSE}
# Find minimum sample size for adequate power
sample_size_analysis_result <- sample_size_analysis(
  effect_size = 0.4,
  target_power = 0.8,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  sample_sizes = seq(30, 120, by = 10),
  n_simulations = 200
)
```

## Step 3: Sensitivity Analysis

```{r workflow_step3, eval=FALSE}
# Test different effect sizes to understand sensitivity
sensitivity_curve <- bayesian_power_curve(
  n_control = 70, # From step 2
  n_treatment = 70,
  effect_sizes = seq(0.2, 0.8, by = 0.1),
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = 200
)

plot_power_curve(sensitivity_curve)
```

# Interpreting Results

## Power Metrics

The package provides three types of power:

1. **ROPE Power**: Probability that the treatment effect is outside the region of practical equivalence. This is often the most relevant for clinical decisions.

2. **Directional Power**: Probability that the treatment effect is in the expected direction (positive or negative).

3. **Significance Power**: Traditional power based on whether the effect is "statistically significant" (similar to frequentist power).

## Convergence

Always check the convergence rate. If it's below 95%, consider:
- Increasing the number of iterations in brms
- Simplifying the model
- Checking for model specification issues

## Effect Size Interpretation

For continuous outcomes:
- 0.2 = small effect
- 0.5 = medium effect  
- 0.8 = large effect

For binary outcomes, effect sizes represent log odds ratios.
For count outcomes, effect sizes represent log rate ratios.

# Best Practices

1. **Use adequate simulations**: For final analyses, use at least 1000 simulations per condition.

2. **Check convergence**: Always examine the convergence rate and individual model fits.

3. **Consider multiple power metrics**: Don't rely solely on one power measure.

4. **Validate with pilot data**: If possible, validate your assumptions with pilot data.

5. **Plan for dropouts**: Increase sample sizes to account for expected dropout rates.

6. **Document assumptions**: Keep track of all assumptions made in the power analysis.

# Conclusion

The `rctbayespower` package provides a comprehensive framework for Bayesian power analysis in RCTs. By incorporating prior information and using probabilistic reasoning, it offers a more nuanced approach to study planning than traditional frequentist methods.

Key advantages include:
- Incorporation of prior knowledge
- Probabilistic interpretation of results
- Flexibility in defining practical significance (ROPE)
- Rich visualization options
