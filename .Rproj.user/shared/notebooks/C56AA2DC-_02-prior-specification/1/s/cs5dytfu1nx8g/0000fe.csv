Optimal Combinations:
====================
No combinations achieved target success power.

No combinations achieved target futility power.

Integrated Power & Probability Results:
======================================
(Using runtime design prior: student_t(3, 0.5, 0.1) )

"

Integrated results represent weighted averages across effect sizes using the specified design prior.
Power = probability of making correct decision, Mean Probability = mean posterior probability of exceeding threshold.
Values shown as percentage (Â±MCSE) where MCSE = Monte Carlo Standard Error.
