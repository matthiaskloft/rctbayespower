\title{Compute Summary Statistics for ANCOVA Batch (BayesFlow Input)}
\usage{
compute_summaries_batch_ancova(data_batch)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_batch}{List with batch-formatted data from prepare_*_batch_bf()
containing: outcome (matrix), covariate (matrix), group (matrix)}
}
\value{
Matrix of summary statistics (batch_size x n_summaries)
}
\description{
Extracts summary statistics from batch simulation data in the format
expected by BayesFlow trained models. The summary statistics must match
exactly what the BayesFlow model was trained on.
}
\details{
For 2-arm ANCOVA, summaries are:
\enumerate{
\item mean_outcome_ctrl, 2. mean_outcome_treat,
\item sd_outcome_ctrl, 4. sd_outcome_treat,
\item n_ctrl, 6. n_treat,
\item cor_outcome_covariate, 8. mean_covariate
}
}
