\title{Interim Function Factory: Success and Futility Stopping}
\usage{
interim_success_futility(success_threshold = 0.99, futility_threshold = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{success_threshold}{Numeric threshold (0-1) for stopping for success.
If the maximum \code{pr_scs} across target parameters exceeds this threshold,
the trial stops for success. Default is 0.99.}

\item{futility_threshold}{Numeric threshold (0-1) for stopping for futility.
If the maximum \code{pr_ftl} across target parameters exceeds this threshold,
the trial stops for futility. Default is 0.90.}
}
\value{
A function with the standard interim function interface
}
\description{
Creates an interim decision function that can stop for either success
or futility. The trial stops early if the posterior probability of
success or futility exceeds the respective threshold.
}
\details{
At each interim analysis, this function first checks for success
(early efficacy), then for futility. Success takes precedence if both
thresholds are exceeded (unlikely but possible with different parameters).

This is the most common interim analysis setup for confirmatory trials.
