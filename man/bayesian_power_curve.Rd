bayesian_power_curve(
  n_control,
  n_treatment,
  effect_sizes = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  n_simulations = 500,

}
\arguments{
\item{n_control}{Number of participants in control group}

\item{n_treatment}{Number of participants in treatment group}

\item{effect_sizes}{Vector of effect sizes to test}

\item{outcome_type}{Type of outcome ("continuous", "binary", "count")}

\item{n_simulations}{Number of simulations per effect size}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to power_analysis()}
}
\value{
A list containing power curve results
}
\description{
Generate power curves across different effect sizes for Bayesian RCTs.
This function helps visualize how power changes with effect size.
