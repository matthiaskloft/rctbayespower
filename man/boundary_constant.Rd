\title{Constant Boundary}
\usage{
boundary_constant(threshold = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{Fixed threshold for all looks. Default 0.95.}
}
\value{
A function that takes information fractions and returns thresholds.
}
\description{
Creates a simple constant boundary function that returns the same threshold
at all analysis timepoints. Unlike \code{\link[=boundary_pocock]{boundary_pocock()}}, this does not
adjust for the number of looks.
}
\details{
This is a simple constant threshold without adjustment for multiple looks.
Using the same threshold at all interim analyses will inflate the overall
Type I error rate compared to a single-look design.

For proper Type I error control, consider using \code{\link[=boundary_pocock]{boundary_pocock()}} which
calibrates the threshold based on the number of looks.
}
\examples{
# Create constant boundary at 0.95
const <- boundary_constant(0.95)

# Returns same value regardless of number of looks
const(c(0.5, 1.0))  # 0.95, 0.95
}
