\title{Re-summarize Results with Different Boundaries}
\usage{
resummarize_boundaries(power_result, thr_dec_eff = NULL, thr_dec_fut = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{power_result}{An rctbp_power_analysis object with completed results}

\item{thr_dec_eff}{New efficacy boundary specification. Can be:
\itemize{
\item NULL to keep original thresholds
\item A single numeric value (same threshold at all looks)
\item A numeric vector (one threshold per look)
\item A boundary function from \code{\link[=boundary_obf]{boundary_obf()}}, \code{\link[=boundary_linear]{boundary_linear()}}, etc.
}}

\item{thr_dec_fut}{New futility boundary specification (same format as thr_dec_eff)}
}
\value{
A new rctbp_power_analysis object with recomputed:
\itemize{
\item \code{results_raw}: Updated decisions and stopping based on new boundaries
\item \code{results_interim}: Re-summarized by-look statistics
\item \code{results_conditions}: Re-summarized overall statistics
}
}
\description{
Apply different stopping boundaries to existing simulation results and return
a new power_analysis object with updated results. Useful for comparing boundary
configurations without re-running simulations.
}
\details{
This function takes the raw posterior probabilities (\code{pr_eff}, \code{pr_fut}) from
existing simulation results and recomputes the binary decisions (\code{dec_eff},
\code{dec_fut}) and stopping behavior using new probability thresholds.

Since posterior probabilities are stored in results_raw, different threshold
configurations can be explored without re-running the computationally expensive
posterior estimation.

\dontrun{
# Run simulation once
result <- power_analysis(conditions, n_sims = 500, analysis_at = c(0.5, 0.75))

# Re-analyze with O'Brien-Fleming-style boundaries
result_obf <- resummarize_boundaries(
  result,
  thr_dec_eff = boundary_obf(0.975),
  thr_dec_fut = boundary_linear(0.70, 0.90)
)

# Compare results
print(result)      # Original boundaries
print(result_obf)  # OBF boundaries
