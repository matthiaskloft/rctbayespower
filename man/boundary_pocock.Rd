\title{Pocock Boundary}
\usage{
boundary_pocock(alpha = NULL, threshold = NULL)

boundary_pocock_threshold(threshold = 0.975)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level for frequentist error control.
Must be between 0 and 0.5. Mutually exclusive with \code{threshold}.}

\item{threshold}{Probability threshold for Bayesian decision rules.
Must be between 0 and 1. Returns constant threshold at all looks.
Mutually exclusive with \code{alpha}.}
}
\value{
A function that takes a vector of information fractions and returns
a vector of thresholds (one per look).
}
\description{
Creates a Pocock-style boundary function with similar thresholds at all
interim analyses. Specify either \code{alpha} for frequentist Type I error
control, or \code{threshold} for Bayesian decision rules.
}
\details{
Pocock boundaries use similar thresholds at all interim analyses,
making it easier to stop early compared to O'Brien-Fleming.

\strong{Frequentist mode} (\code{alpha}): Uses the Lan-DeMets Pocock spending
function to control Type I error:
\deqn{\alpha(t) = \alpha \ln(1 + (e - 1) t)}
When \code{gsDesign} is installed, computes exact boundaries. Otherwise uses
a lookup table (accurate for equally spaced looks only).

\strong{Bayesian mode} (\code{threshold}): Returns the same threshold at every
analysis. Note that using the same threshold at multiple looks will have
different operating characteristics than a single-look design.
}
\examples{
# Frequentist: control Type I error at 2.5\%
pocock_freq <- boundary_pocock(alpha = 0.025)
pocock_freq(c(0.5, 1.0))

# Bayesian: constant 0.95 threshold at all looks
pocock_bayes <- boundary_pocock(threshold = 0.95)
pocock_bayes(c(0.5, 1.0))  # Returns c(0.95, 0.95)
