\title{Plot Power Analysis Results}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An rctbp_power_analysis object that has been run with results}

\item{type}{Type of plot to create:
\itemize{
\item "auto" - Automatically detect best plot type based on analysis (default)
\item "power_curve" - Power curve across single varying dimension
\item "heatmap" - 2D heatmap when both sample sizes and effect sizes vary
\item "integrated" - Integrated power results when design prior is used
\item "comparison" - Compare power vs posterior probabilities
}}

\item{metric}{Which power metric to display:
\itemize{
\item "success" - Success power and probability
\item "futility" - Futility power and probability
\item "both" - Both success and futility power and probabilities (default)
}}

\item{values}{Which values to display:
\itemize{
\item "both" - Both power and posterior probabilities (default)
\item "power" - Power only
\item "post_prob" - Posterior probabilities only
}}

\item{show_target}{Whether to show target power lines (default: TRUE)}

\item{show_integrated}{Whether to include integrated power when available (default: TRUE)}

\item{facet_by}{For power_curve plots when both sample sizes and effect sizes vary:
\itemize{
\item "effect_size" - Facet by effect size, vary sample size on x-axis (default)
\item "sample_size" - Facet by sample size, vary effect size on x-axis
}}

\item{design_prior}{Optional design prior for runtime integrated power computation. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A string in brms prior syntax (e.g., "normal(0.3, 0.1)", "student_t(6, 0.5, 0.2)")
\item An R function taking effect size as input (e.g., function(x) dnorm(x, 0.5, 0.2))
\item NULL for no runtime integration (default)
}
If provided, integrated power will be computed using this design prior instead of
any design prior specified in the original rctbp_power_analysis object.
Only valid when effect sizes vary (length > 1).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotly functions}
}
\value{
A plotly object for all plot types (power curves, heatmaps, and comparison plots)
}
\description{
Create comprehensive visualizations for power analysis results from rctbp_power_analysis objects.
Supports different plot types based on analysis type (sample_only, effect_only, or both varying).
}
