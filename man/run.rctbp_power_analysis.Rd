\arguments{
\item{x}{An S7 object of class "rctbp_power_analysis"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
The modified S7 object of class "rctbp_power_analysis" with results
populated in the following properties:
\itemize{
\item results_conditions: Aggregated power analysis results (data.frame)
\item results_interim: Per-look interim results for sequential designs (data.frame)
\item results_raw: Raw per-simulation data (data.frame)
\item elapsed_time: Total analysis runtime (difftime)
}
}
\description{
Executes the Bayesian power analysis using the configuration specified in
the rctbp_power_analysis object. This method contains the core simulation
logic and returns comprehensive results.
}
\details{
This method implements the core power analysis algorithm:

\strong{Parallel Execution:} When n_cores > 1, simulations are distributed
across multiple cores for optimal performance.

\strong{Progress Tracking:} Progress is shown through pbapply when available,
with fallback to basic progress reporting.

\strong{Error Handling:} Robust error handling ensures partial results are
preserved even if some simulations fail.

\strong{Result Aggregation:} Individual simulation results are aggregated
into power curves and summary statistics.
