\arguments{
\item{x}{An S7 object of class "rctbp_power_analysis"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A list of class "rctbayespower_sim_result" containing:
\itemize{
\item results_df: Aggregated power analysis results
\item results_df_raw: Raw simulation results from all runs
\item design: The design object used for analysis
\item conditions: The condition specifications used
\item n_sims: Number of simulations per condition
\item elapsed_time: Total analysis runtime
}
}
\description{
Executes the Bayesian power analysis using the configuration specified in
the rctbp_power_analysis object. This method contains the core simulation
logic and returns comprehensive results.
}
\details{
This method implements the core power analysis algorithm:

\strong{Parallel Execution:} When n_cores > 1, simulations are distributed
across multiple cores for optimal performance.

\strong{Progress Tracking:} Progress is shown through pbapply when available,
with fallback to basic progress reporting.

\strong{Error Handling:} Robust error handling ensures partial results are
preserved even if some simulations fail.

\strong{Result Aggregation:} Individual simulation results are aggregated
into power curves and summary statistics.
