\title{O'Brien-Fleming Boundary}
\usage{
boundary_obf(alpha = NULL, threshold = NULL)

boundary_obf_threshold(threshold = 0.975)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level for frequentist error control.
Must be between 0 and 0.5. Mutually exclusive with \code{threshold}.}

\item{threshold}{Final probability threshold for Bayesian decision rules.
Must be between 0.5 and 1 (exclusive). Mutually exclusive with \code{alpha}.}
}
\value{
A function that takes a vector of information fractions and returns
a vector of probability thresholds (one per look).
}
\description{
Creates a boundary function with O'Brien-Fleming shape (very conservative
early, relaxing toward final analysis). Specify either \code{alpha} for
frequentist Type I error control, or \code{threshold} for Bayesian decision rules.
}
\details{
O'Brien-Fleming boundaries are very conservative at early looks (hard to
stop for success) but relax toward the final analysis. This preserves
most of the sample size and statistical power for the final look.

\strong{Frequentist mode} (\code{alpha}): Uses the Lan-DeMets spending function
to control Type I error. The spending function is:
\deqn{\alpha(t) = 2 - 2\Phi(\Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha/2) / \sqrt{t})}
When \code{gsDesign} is installed, computes exact boundaries using multivariate
normal integration.

\strong{Bayesian mode} (\code{threshold}): Uses the OBF shape but scales it to
end at the specified probability threshold. Early looks are very stringent
(close to 1.0), relaxing to exactly \code{threshold} at the final analysis.
}
\examples{
# Frequentist: control Type I error at 2.5\%
obf_freq <- boundary_obf(alpha = 0.025)
obf_freq(c(0.5, 1.0))

# Bayesian: OBF shape ending at 0.95 threshold
obf_bayes <- boundary_obf(threshold = 0.95)
obf_bayes(c(0.5, 1.0))
