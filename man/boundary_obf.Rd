\title{O'Brien-Fleming-like Bayesian Boundary}
\usage{
boundary_obf(base = 0.975)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{Threshold at final analysis (info_frac = 1). Default 0.975.}
}
\value{
A function that takes information fraction and returns threshold.
}
\description{
Creates a boundary function that is stringent at early looks and relaxes
toward the final analysis. Approximates O'Brien-Fleming spending function
behavior in a Bayesian context.
}
\details{
Formula: \code{threshold = 1 - (1 - base) * sqrt(info_frac)}

Example values for \code{base = 0.975}:
\itemize{
\item info_frac = 0.25 → threshold = 0.9875
\item info_frac = 0.50 → threshold = 0.9823
\item info_frac = 0.75 → threshold = 0.9783

\item info_frac = 1.00 → threshold = 0.9750
}

This boundary is very conservative at early looks (hard to stop early for
success) but relaxes to the nominal threshold at the final analysis.

\examples{
# Create OBF-style boundary
obf <- boundary_obf(0.975)

# Evaluate at different information fractions
obf(0.25)  # Early look: ~0.9875
obf(0.50)  # Midpoint: ~0.9823
obf(1.00)  # Final: 0.975

# Use in design
