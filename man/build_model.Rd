  pre_defined_model = NULL,
  data_simulation_fn,
  brms_model,
  n_endpoints = NULL,
  endpoint_types = NULL,
  n_arms = NULL,
  n_repeated_measures = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{pre_defined_model}{Optional character string specifying a predefined model
to use instead of creating a custom model. Currently supported values:
\itemize{
\item "ancova_cont" - ANCOVA model for continuous outcomes with baseline covariate
}
When specified, other parameters are ignored and the predefined model is returned.}

\item{data_simulation_fn}{A function that simulates data for the RCT. Must take
parameters n_total, p_alloc, and further parameters needed for
data simulation.}

\item{brms_model}{A fitted brmsfit object that serves as the template model.
This should be compiled without posterior draws (chains = 0) for efficiency.}

\item{n_endpoints}{Number of endpoints in the study (must be positive integer)}

\item{endpoint_types}{Character vector specifying the type of each endpoint.
Valid types are "continuous", "binary", "count". Length must match n_endpoints.}

\item{n_arms}{Number of arms in the study including control arm (must be positive integer)}

\item{n_repeated_measures}{Number of repeated measures per participant.
Use NULL or 0 for single time point studies.}

\item{model_name}{Optional character string providing a descriptive name for the model}
}
\value{
An S7 object of class "rctbayespower_model" containing the specified properties
}
\description{
Constructs a build_model object that encapsulates a data simulation
function, a compiled brms model, and associated metadata for power analysis.
This object serves as the foundation for Bayesian power analysis in RCTs.
}
\details{
The build_model class encapsulates all components needed for power
analysis simulation:

\strong{Predefined Models:} For convenience, users can specify pre_defined_model
to use ready-made model configurations. This is the recommended approach for
standard analyses. When using predefined models, other parameters are ignored.

\strong{Custom Models:} For advanced users, custom models can be created by
providing all required parameters:

\strong{Data Simulation Function:} Must accept n_total (total sample size),
p_alloc (vector of allocation probabilities), and true_parameter_values
(named list of parameter values). The function should return a data.frame with
simulated baseline data ready for outcome generation.

\strong{BRMS Model:} A compiled brms model that will be used as a template.
The model should be fitted with minimal chains (e.g., chains = 0) to serve
as a compilation template only.

\strong{Validation:} The function validates that the data simulation function
has the required parameter structure and that the brms model is properly fitted.
