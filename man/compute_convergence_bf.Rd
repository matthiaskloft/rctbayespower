\title{Compute Convergence Diagnostics for BayesFlow Samples}
\usage{
compute_convergence_bf(draws_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws_mat}{Matrix of posterior draws (n_sims x n_post_draws)}
}
\value{
List with rhat, ess_bulk, ess_tail vectors (length = n_sims)
}
\description{
Computes rhat, ess_bulk, and ess_tail for BayesFlow posterior samples.
For BayesFlow (IID samples), these metrics assess sample quality rather
than MCMC chain convergence. Split-rhat is used (splits samples in half).
}
\details{
Uses vectorized computation: all simulations are processed as separate
"variables" in a single draws_array, allowing batch computation.
