create_power_plot(
  x,
  type = "auto",
  metric = "both",
  values = "both",
  show_target = TRUE,
  show_mcse = FALSE,
  facet_by = "effect_size",
  target_power = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An rctbp_power_analysis object that has been run with results}

\item{type}{Type of plot to create:
\itemize{
\item "auto" - Automatically detect best plot type based on analysis (default)
\item "power_curve" - Power curve across single varying dimension
\item "heatmap" - 2D heatmap when both sample sizes and effect sizes vary
\item "comparison" - Compare power vs posterior probabilities
}}

\item{metric}{Which power metric to display:
\itemize{
\item "success" - Success power and probability
\item "futility" - Futility power and probability
\item "both" - Both success and futility power and probabilities (default)
}}

\item{values}{Which values to display:
\itemize{
\item "both" - Both power and posterior probabilities (default)
\item "power" - Power only
\item "post_prob" - Posterior probabilities only
}}

\item{show_target}{Whether to show target power lines (default: TRUE)}

\item{show_mcse}{Whether to show Monte Carlo standard error ribbons for uncertainty
visualization (default: FALSE). Only applies to power_curve plots.}

\item{facet_by}{For power_curve plots when both sample sizes and effect sizes vary:
\itemize{
\item "effect_size" - Facet by effect size, vary sample size on x-axis (default)
\item "sample_size" - Facet by sample size, vary effect size on x-axis
\item "look" - For sequential designs, facet by interim analysis look
}}

\item{target_power}{Optional numeric value (0-1) for drawing contour lines on heatmaps
at the specified target power level. If NULL (default), uses the design's p_sig_scs.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions}
