)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sizes}{Vector of sample sizes}

\item{effect_sizes_grid}{List where each element is a named list of effect sizes for target parameters}

\item{n_interim_analyses}{Vector of interim analysis counts (default: 0)}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to include in each condition}
}
\value{
List of condition specifications

\description{
Helper function to create a conditions list from standard grid parameters.
