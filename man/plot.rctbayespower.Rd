\title{Plot Power Analysis Results}
\usage{
\method{plot}{rctbayespower}(x, type = "comparison", metric = "both", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'rctbayespower' returned by power_analysis()}

\item{type}{Type of plot to create. For single power analysis results, only
"comparison" is supported, showing power vs posterior probabilities}

\item{metric}{Which power metric to display:
\itemize{
\item "success" - Success power and probability
\item "futility" - Futility power and probability
\item "both" - Both success and futility power and probabilities (default)
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing power analysis results
}
\description{
Create visualizations for single power analysis results by converting them to
a grid format and using the existing grid plotting functionality.
