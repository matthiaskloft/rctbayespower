\title{Process Batch of Work Units (BayesFlow Batching)}
\usage{
worker_process_batch(work_units, design)
}
\arguments{
\item{work_units}{List of work unit specifications, each with id_cond, id_iter, condition_args}

\item{design}{Design object (S7 or list for parallel workers)}
}
\value{
Data frame with results for all work units and all analyses
}
\description{
Processes a batch of (id_cond, id_iter) work units together. Only used when
backend = "bf" (BayesFlow) and batch_size > 1. Enables efficient batch processing
through neural posterior estimation.
